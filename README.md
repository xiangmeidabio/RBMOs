- 1-RBMOs_seurat.R

    - This code pertains to the reading, quality control, processing, and cell annotation of RBMOs data. Additionally, it includes the analysis of erythrocytes subsets within RBMOs.

- 2-RBMOs_blood_seurat.R

    - This code pertains to the reading, quality control, processing, and cell annotation of data derived from blood cells excreted by RBMOs. Additionally, it includes the analysis of subpopulations of erythrocytes among the blood cells produced by these organoids.

- 3-ABM_FBM_RBMOs_Data_integration.R
  
    - This code focuses on the reading and processing of data from fetal bone marrow and adult bone marrow, as well as the integration and correlation analysis of fetal bone marrow and RBMOs data, and adult bone marrow and RBMOs data. Additionally, it encompasses the integration and correlation analysis of fetal bone marrow, adult bone marrow, and RBMOs data.

- 4-Monocle3.R
  
    - This code performs pseudotime trajectory analysis on erythrocytes derived from RBMOs. It also analyzes the differences in gene expression at various stages of erythrocyte development using pseudotime trajectory analysis.
